# mced
`mced` is a MineCraft EDitor, focused on simplicity and speed. It is coded in C,
intended first for the CLI and only secondarily as a GUI tool, if it even gets
there.

External libraries will be used as little as possible, only when a clear
standard exists. `mced` is strictly POSIX compliant, and shall not use **any**
non-portable libraries and/or system calls or extensions ; with the sole ( and
possibly temporary ) exception of GNU make.
